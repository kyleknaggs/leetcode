2: INTRODUCTION AND COURSE OVERVIEW

---------------------------------
---------------------------------

Algorithms are the recipes that programmers use to solve difficult problems on a computer.

You can use algorithms to:
  1. Store and retrieve data
  2. Sort the items in a list
  3. Find the shortest path
  ...and many other things.

Computer Science has many algorithms so this course is only going to include the "most useful" algorithms.

The topics that will be covered are:
  1. Complexity Theory
  2. How to Determine how fast or slow an algorithm is
  3. Numerical algorithms
  4. Linked lists
  5. Array algorithms
  6. Stacks and queues
  7. Sorting algorithms
  8. Common Hashing Techniques
  9. Recursion
  10. Backtracking algorithms
  11. Trees and Tree algorithms
  12. Network algorithms
